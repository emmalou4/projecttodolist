# The To Do List 
The To Do List was inspired by my love to make lists. I love making lists but sometimes it's hard for me to remember to go back back to the list and modify or "delete" things that I have completed throughout the day. This app allows to you modify and delete the items on your list as you go through on one handy web app. 

## Technologies Used
JavaScript
Express
HTML
CSS
MongoDB
Heroku
GitHub

## Future Enhancements
I would like to add a slicker style where the list is contianed in a box that is centered on the screen and switch up the button styles. I would also like to add more features such as, time/date, a "notepad" where people can flip through their previous todo lists. I'd like to add an urgent feature where you can tag the urgency of a task and it goes to the top of the list. It would also be cool if you were able to share your todo lists via text or messenger if you'd like to collborate on a list or show someone your list.
